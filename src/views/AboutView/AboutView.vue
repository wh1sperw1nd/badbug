    <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, Thank you for taking the time to visit me!</p>
    <p>Tea, coffee, or something stronger?</p>
    <p>What can I tell you about myself?</p>
    <p>
      My name is Alexander, but you can call me Alex. For
      friends, I'm just Frost. As you've probably figured
      out, I'm a web developer and JS coder, a former
      student of VNAU, and a bit of a slacker). I do this
      just a little bit, about 12 years. I know, someone
      might say that's not much experience. Of course, I
      don't claim to be a universal genius, but as it
      seems to me, during this time, I've learned a lot,
      and most importantly, I continue to expand my
      knowledge and thus develop. My main quality: I'm
      just insanely interested in everything related to
      the web. I find in it entertainment, creativity,
      relaxation, and work. And, in my opinion, that's
      very, very important. So, I'm confident that I'll
      continue to develop in this direction.
    </p>

        explain why I did it that way, not another way.

      <li>
        20. I believe that graphic design is mostly
        useless. (In fact, it's not entirely true. It is

        digital", "LCD - CRT", "Windows - Linux", "Canon
        - Nikon", "iOS - Android"... I just know the

        47. But I agree with it only after careful
        consideration.
      </li>
      <li>
        48. There are very few people who do their job
        well, but many who talk about it. I really don't

      </li>

      <li>
        61. I don't like studying in
        school/college/university. It's a useless waste

        little useful there (see above).
      </li>
      <li>
        63. Everything necessary can be learned
        independently. You just need to want to.
      </li>
      <li>
        64. I believe it's better to read the
        documentation, Google things, dance with a
        tambourine, and figure it out on your own than
        to bother someone with silly questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        65. At the same time, I love helping people and
        answering their silly questions.
      </li>

        66. I enrolled in a weekend program to remember
        the word "university" as rarely as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        67. I don't think that having or not having a
        higher education says anything about a person. I

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Computers, Internet, Communication...</h2>
    <ul>

        I never leave home without.
      </li>
      <li>
        70. I respect Microsoft. And Bill Gates is
        indeed a genius, although not always guided by
        the interests of users. But Macs are still
        better :)
      </li>
      <li>
        71. I don't use emojis. Some people use them too
        much, and they lose all meaning. But lately, I
        often write the word "emoji". Now I use them,
        but not fanatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        72. I try to write in Russian everywhere. There
        is no separate language on the Internet, only
        Russian and its ignorance.
      </li>
      <li>73. I never write the letter "ё".</li>
      <li>
        74. I try to use correct quotation marks,
        dashes, and so on wherever possible (and with
        the typographic layout of the keyboard, it's
        possible almost everywhere). I can't understand
        why Word inserts a minus instead of a dash.
      </li>
      <li>75. I've never changed my ICQ number.</li>
      <li>
        76. I've never changed my phone number due to a
        lack of money on the account.
      </li>
      <li>
        77. I remember the ICQ number and mobile number
        by heart.
      </li>
      <li>78. I remember only a few other numbers.</li>
      <li>
        79. I talk on my mobile phone for 10–60 minutes
        0–10 minutes a day. I don't use the home phone.
      </li>
      <li>
        80. I don't understand people who are on the
        Internet at night (from 12 AM until morning).
      </li>
      <li>
        81. I'm happy when I receive an email from a
        good person.
      </li>
      <li>
        82. I have a lot of people in my contact list
        (relatively, of course), but I'm only interested
        in communicating with a few of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        83. I spend 8–12 hours a day on the computer.
      </li>
      <li>84. I'm online for 8–12 hours a day.</li>
      <li>
        85. But there are days when I don't turn it on
        at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        86. I don't consider myself fluent in any
        programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        87. I don't consider myself knowledgeable about
        computers.
      </li>
      <li>
        88. I use Windows Explorer. I can't use Far
        Manager, Total Commander, and other Norton
        Commander clones.
      </li>
      <li>
        89. I don't understand how people can use Linux,
        Gimp, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        90. I believe that people who write code in
        Windows Notepad and are proud of it are either
        imbeciles, or they have an unlimited amount of
        time, or they simply have never written a lot of
        code.
      </li>
      <li>91. Tried to use Linux. Didn't like it.</li>
      <li>
        92. I like Windows 7 because it's fast and
        stable.
      </li>
      <li>
        93. I believe that the most important parts of a
        computer are the monitor, keyboard, mouse,
        tablet, chair, and table. It is through them
        that a person interacts with the computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        94. The Internet is as real as everything else.
        People there are real too.
      </li>
      <li>
        95. I don't understand why in Ukraine it's
        common to take someone else's materials and post
        them on your site. Why not just provide a link.
      </li>
      <li>
        96. I don't understand the laziness of people to
        put a link to the author when publishing someone
        else's work.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        97. I believe that any item should be
        comfortable above all. Buying something just
        because it's beautiful/fashionable/cool is
        foolish.
      </li>
      <li>
        98. I have very high standards for the things I
        use.
      </li>
      <li>
        99. I love it when everything is in its place.
      </li>
      <li>
        100. When choosing a product, I try not to be

        what is optimal for me.
